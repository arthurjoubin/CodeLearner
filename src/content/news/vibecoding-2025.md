## Defining Vibecoding

**Vibecoding** is a development approach where you describe what you want to create (the "vibe") rather than explicitly writing each line of code. AI then translates that intent into functional code.

### The Origins

The term emerged from the designer/dev community looking for ways to prototype quickly without going through the tedious technical implementation step.

### Why It's Exploding in 2025

1. **Speed**: Projects that took weeks now take hours
2. **Accessibility**: Non-developers can create applications
3. **Experimentation**: Testing ideas becomes easy

### The Risks

Vibecoding isn't without danger:
- **Technical Debt**: Generated code can be hard to maintain
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities can be introduced without the developer noticing
- **Understanding**: You can't debug what you don't understand

### The Perfect Balance

The solution isn't to reject vibecoding but to adopt it wisely. Use it to prototype and accelerate, but maintain a solid understanding of the fundamentals.
