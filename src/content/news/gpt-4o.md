## The Model That Actually Understands

GPT-4o ("o" for "omni") marks a turning point in coding assistants. Its ability to reason about complex code and understand developer intentions far exceeds its predecessors.

### Strengths

1. **Contextual Understanding**: GPT-4o keeps the entire project in memory
2. **Multi-file Reasoning**: It can connect components scattered across a codebase
3. **Clear Explanations**: Its pedagogical explanations make it an excellent mentor

### Limitations

Despite its impressive capabilities, GPT-4o remains a tool. It can hallucinate, propose non-optimal solutions, or misinterpret specific requirements. Human validation remains essential.

### Impact on Learning

For programming students, GPT-4o is a double-edged sword. It can accelerate learning by explaining complex concepts but also risk creating harmful dependency.

The key: use it as a tutor, not a substitute for thinking.
