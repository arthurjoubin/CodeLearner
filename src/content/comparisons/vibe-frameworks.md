## The Rise of Vibe Frameworks

These tools allow creating complete applications from a simple text description. Here's how they compare.

## Bolt.new
The most complete. Allows creating full-stack applications with database, auth, and deployment. Premium price but justified value.

## Lovable
The accessible alternative to Bolt. Fewer features but excellent for quick MVPs. Intuitive interface for beginners.

## V0 (Vercel)
Specialized in UI interfaces. Perfect for generating clean, responsive React/Tailwind components.

## Windsurf
The IDE-first approach. Integrates vibecoding into a complete development environment.

## Recommended Use Cases

| Tool | Best for | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Bolt.new | Full SaaS | $$$ |
| Lovable | Quick MVPs | $$ |
| V0 | UI/Components | $ |
| Windsurf | Dev workflow | $$ |

## Our Recommendation
