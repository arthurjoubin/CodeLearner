## Cursor Pro Trial

Cursor is offering an extended free trial for new users to experience all Pro features without commitment.

## Pro Features Unlocked

- **Unlimited autocomplete** - No daily limits
- **Agent mode** - Let AI write and edit code autonomously
- **Context awareness** - Understanding your entire codebase
- **Custom rules** - Train Cursor on your codebase patterns
- **Team features** - Share prompts and configurations

## What Makes Cursor Different

Unlike other AI assistants, Cursor is built as a fork of VS Code with AI deeply integrated at every level. This means:
- Better context understanding
- Smoother editing experience
- No extension conflicts

## How to Get Started

1. Download Cursor from cursor.sh
2. Create a new account
3. The 3-month trial activates automatically
4. No credit card required

## After the Trial

If you love it (and you will), the Pro plan is $20/month. Compare that to the value of the time saved on debugging and boilerplate code.
