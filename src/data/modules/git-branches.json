They let you work on different features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.\n\n## What is a Branch?\n\nThink of branches like parallel universes for your code:\n- **main branch**: The stable, production-ready code\n- **feature branches**: Where you develop new features\n- **bugfix branches**: Where you fix issues\n\n```\nmain:     A---B---C---F---G (production)\n               \\         /\nfeature:        D---E---/   (new feature)\n```\n\n## Why Use Branches?\n\n1. **Isolation**: Work on features without breaking the main code\n2. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different features\n3. **Experimentation**: Try ideas without consequences\n4. **Code Review**: Merge only after review and testing\n\n## Default Branch\n\nWhen you create a repository, Git creates a default branch:\n- Historically called `master`\n- Modern convention uses `main`\n- You can check with: `git branch`\n\n## Branch Workflow\n\n```\n1. Create a branch: git branch feature-name\n2. Switch to it: git checkout feature-name\n3. Make changes and commit\n4. Switch back: git checkout main\n5. Merge: git merge feature-name\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Keep the main branch stable and deployable\n- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix\n- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/header-alignment`\n- Delete branches after merging to keep things clean",
      "codeExample": "# List all branches\ngit branch\n\n# List all branches including remote ones\ngit branch -a\n\n# See which branch you're on (marked with *)\n# main\n# * feature-login    ← you're here\n# feature-signup"
