      "content": "# Essential to know\n- Git is a **distributed version control system**\n- It tracks changes to files over time\n- Allows multiple people to work on the same project\n- You can revert to any previous version of your code\n- Git is NOT GitHub (GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories)\n\n---\n\n# What is Git?\n\nGit is a **version control system** that helps you track changes in your code. Think of it as a time machine for your projects - you can save snapshots of your work and go back to any point in time.\n\n## Why Use Git?\n\n1. **Track Changes**: See exactly what changed, when, and by whom\n2. **Collaborate**: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work\n3. **Backup**: Your code is safely stored and can be recovered\n4. **Experiment**: Try new features in isolation without breaking the main code\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Repository (Repo)\nA repository is a folder that Git watches. It contains:\n- Your project files\n- The history of all changes\n- Git configuration\n\n### Commit\nA commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific moment. Each commit has:\n- A unique ID (hash)\n- A message describing what changed\n- The author and timestamp\n- The actual changes made\n\n### Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository\n\n```\nWorking Directory → Staging Area → Repository\n   (your files)      (git add)      (git commit)\n```\n\n1. **Working Directory**: Your actual files on disk\n2. **Staging Area**: A temporary holding area for changes you want to commit\n3. **Repository**: The permanent storage of all commits\n\n## Git vs GitHub\n\n- **Git**: The tool/software that tracks changes locally on your computer\n- **GitHub**: A website that hosts Git repositories online (like Dropbox for code)\n\nYou can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub makes sharing and collaborating easier.",
      "codeExample": "# Check if Git is installed\ngit --version\n\n# Configure your identity (do this once)\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your@email.com\"\n\n# Check your configuration\ngit config --list"

      "content": "# Essential to know\n- Use `git init` to create a new Git repository\n- This creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores all Git data\n- Only run this once per project\n- You can check if a folder is a repo by looking for the `.git` folder\n\n---\n\n# Initializing a Repository\n\nTo start tracking a project with Git, you need to initialize a repository.\n\n## Creating a New Repository\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your project folder\ncd my-project\n\n# Initialize Git\ngit init\n```\n\nYou'll see output like:\n```\nInitialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-project/.git/\n```\n\n## What Happens?\n\nGit creates a hidden `.git` folder containing:\n- All commit history\n- Branch information\n- Configuration files\n- Staging area data\n\n**Never delete or modify the `.git` folder manually!**\n\n## Checking Repository Status\n\nAfter initializing, check the status:\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\nThis shows:\n- Which branch you're on\n- Untracked files (new files Git doesn't know about)\n- Modified files (files that have changed)\n- Staged files (changes ready to be committed)\n\n## Common First Steps\n\n```bash\n# 1. Initialize the repo\ngit init\n\n# 2. Create a .gitignore file (optional but recommended)\necho \"node_modules/\" > .gitignore\n\n# 3. Check status\ngit status\n```\n\nThe `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore (like dependencies, build files, or secrets).",

Think of staging like putting items in a box before shipping them.\n\n## Staging Individual Files\n\n```bash\n# Stage a specific file\ngit add index.html\n\n# Stage multiple specific files\ngit add index.html style.css\n```\n\n## Staging All Changes\n\n```bash\n# Stage all changes in current directory\ngit add .\n\n# Stage all changes in the entire repository\ngit add -A\n```\n\n## What Gets Staged?\n\nWhen you run `git add`:\n- ✅ New files are tracked\n- ✅ Modified files are updated\n- ✅ Deleted files are marked for removal\n\n## Checking What's Staged\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\nShows:\n- **Changes to be committed**: Files in staging area (green)\n- **Changes not staged**: Modified files not yet staged (red)\n- **Untracked files**: New files Git doesn't know about (red)\n\n## Unstaging Files\n\nMade a mistake? Remove files from staging:\n\n```bash\n# Unstage a specific file\ngit restore --staged filename.txt\n\n# Unstage all files\ngit restore --staged .\n```\n\n## Interactive Staging\n\nFor more control, use interactive mode:\n\n```bash\n# Stage changes interactively\ngit add -p\n```\n\nThis lets you review and stage changes chunk by chunk.",
