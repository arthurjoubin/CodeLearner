Vercel (The creators of Next.js)\nBest choice for Next.js apps, but works with any framework.\n- **Features**: Edge functions, Image optimization, Analytics.\n- **Workflow**: Connect GitHub \u2192 Pick repository \u2192 Deploy.\n\n## 2. Netlify\nFamous for its excellent Developer Experience (DX).\n- **Features**: Forms handling, Auth, Edge functions.\n- **Workflow**: Very similar to Vercel.\n\n## 3. Cloudflare Pages\nIncredibly fast and integrated with Cloudflare's massive network.\n- **Features**: Unlimited bandwidth, Edge computing (Workers).\n\n## The \"Push to Deploy\" Workflow\n\n1. You write code locally.\n2. You `git commit` and `git push` to GitHub.\n3. The platform detects the change.\n4. It runs `npm run build` on their servers.\n5. It deploys the new version globally in seconds.",

      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "content": "# Essential to know\n- Single Page Apps (SPA) handle routing in the browser\n- Servers don't know about `/about` or `/dashboard` routes\n- You must redirect all 404s back to `index.html`\n\n---\n\n# The SPA Routing Problem\n\nWhen you use `react-router-dom`, your routes like `/profile` only exist in JavaScript. \n\nIf a user refreshes the page on `/profile`, the server looks for a file called `profile.html`. Since it doesn't exist, the server returns a **404 Not Found**.\n\n## The Solution: Redirects\n\nYou need to tell your host: \"If you don't find the file, just serve index.html and let React handle the rest.\"\n\n### For Vercel (`vercel.json`)\n```json\n{\n  \"rewrites\": [{ \"source\": \"/(.*)\", \"destination\": \"/index.html\" }]\n}\n```\n\n### For Netlify (`_redirects` file)\n```text\n/*    /index.html   200\n```",
