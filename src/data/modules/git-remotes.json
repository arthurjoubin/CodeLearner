      "content": "# Essential to know\n- Remote repositories are copies of your repo hosted elsewhere (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)\n- `origin` is the default name for your main remote\n- You can have multiple remotes\n- Remotes enable collaboration and backup\n- Git is distributed - you have a full copy of the repository\n\n---\n\n# Understanding Remote Repositories\n\nRemote repositories allow you to collaborate with others and keep backups of your code on services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.\n\n## What is a Remote?\n\nA remote is a version of your repository hosted on the internet or network:\n\n```\nYour Computer          Remote Server (GitHub)\n    ↓                         ↓\nLocal Repo  ←——————→  Remote Repo\n    ↑        push/pull       ↑\n  Working                  Shared\n```\n\n## Common Remote Services\n\n- **GitHub**: Most popular, great for open source\n- **GitLab**: Open source alternative, built-in CI/CD\n- **Bitbucket**: Atlassian product, integrates with Jira\n- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's solution\n\n## The Origin\n\nWhen you clone a repository, Git automatically names the remote `origin`:\n\n```bash\n# This creates a remote called 'origin'\ngit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git\n```\n\nYou can see this with:\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)\n# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)\n```\n\n## Local vs Remote\n\n| Local | Remote |\n|-------|--------|\n| On your computer | On a server |\n| Private work | Shared with team |\n| Fast operations | Network required |\n| Full history | Full history |\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\n```\n1. Work locally on a branch\n2. Commit your changes\n3. Push commits to remote\n4. Others pull your changes\n5. Collaborate!\n```\n\n## Why Use Remotes?\n\n1. **Backup**: Your code is safe on a server\n2. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can contribute\n3. **Sharing**: Open source or showcase your work\n4. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment\n5. **Documentation**: README, wikis, issues",

Downloads all files and folders\n2. Downloads complete history (all commits)\n3. Downloads all branches\n4. Sets up 'origin' remote automatically\n5. Checks out the default branch (usually main)\n\n## After Cloning\n\n```bash\n# Go into the project folder\ncd repository\n\n# Check the remote\ngit remote -v\n# Shows: origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git\n\n# See all branches\ngit branch -a\n# Shows local and remote branches\n```\n\n## Cloning Specific Branches\n\n```bash\n# Clone only a specific branch\ngit clone --branch feature-name --single-branch https://github.com/user/repo.git\n\n# Clone with all branches (default)\ngit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git\n```\n\n## Shallow Clone (Faster)\n\nFor large repositories, clone only recent history:\n\n```bash\n# Clone only the last 10 commits\ngit clone --depth 10 https://github.com/user/repo.git\n```",
